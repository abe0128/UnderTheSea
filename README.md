About the game: Under the Sea takes place in the Monterey Bay and follows a young otter named Monty, on his quest to make his way across the bay on his own to be re-united with his familly after being seperated by a storm. In this demo Monty must travers sharks, octopuses and other creatures to reach his home. Armed with a kelp whip, a limited number of rocks and a tail attack he must use them strategically in order to effectively dispatch his obstacles. But in order to heal and gain lives he must break the conviniently placed boxes and break them to consume the yummy crab inside.

Notes: Under the Sea started out as a personal project and was then turned into a school project, now I'm continuing to plan the next steps of Under the Sea. The UI needs to be fixed in order to match the size of any screan, add pollution as obsticles, complete bonus areas, correct Montys course when destroying boxes, he deviates from his plane and ends up misaligned and unable to interact with surrounding objects. Since the game is 2.5D, Monty is set along a fixed plane (moves left, right, up and down only) while the camera is perpendicular to monty. Also, start implementing the second and third level. The current demo being the 1st, the second was planned to be randomly-generated city of tall buildings in which the player has to travers by rooftop without "falling" (since its under the ocean we'll just say he gets tired and drops and dies from the pressure...MAGIC!...GAMES :D). The third level would be the boss fight in which Monty must fight...CTHULHU!
